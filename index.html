            <h3>Loading round...Remember, he is not patient but don't rush.</h3>
            <p>Your partner is being held hostage, but the only way to save him/her is by playing a twisted game with one of the abductors</p>
            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <p>1 bullet will be stored in a gun with 6 empty chambers. After storing, the cyllinder will be spinned to declare the chances of winning or losing to one of the players.
                The player will repeatedly pull the trigger on each turn going back and forth from the abductor to himself until the gun goes off. It's a fair game, 
                just don't attempt to run away.
            </p><br>
            <p>But don't worry! The probability of you winning is 5/6.</p>
